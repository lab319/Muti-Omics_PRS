The Transcriptional Risk Scores for Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma Using XGBoost and Multiple Omics Data.(under review)

This repository contains python implementation of the algorithms proposed in "The Transcriptional Risk Scores for Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma Using XGBoost and Multiple Omics Data".

The datasets of the program
The datasets used during the current study are available from the TCGA website (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

The describe of the program

Data preprocessing: preprocessed data can be used to test the models, the programs can directly process the data downloaded by TCGA.

model: TRS method utilizing multiple omics data and XGBoost model and a combination model of TRS derived from each omic data
